"Jai-Kisaan: Farmers Friend" is a Proof Of Concept(POC) implementing a deep learning model along with added calculations. It presents a simple engine to solve two major problems
in agriculture i.e. Detection of disease in crops and selection of crops that best suits the given weather and soil conditions along with the variety of seed. The deep learning
model used is convolutional neural network that attempts to predict the disease based upon the probability calculated through image processing. While in case of selection of crops, a number of calculations, a combination of metric system is used to predict the best crop.
