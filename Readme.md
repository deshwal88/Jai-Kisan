"Jai-Kisaan: Farmers Friend" is an application of deep learning along with added calculations. The web application presents an efficient engine to solve two major problems
in agriculture i.e. Detection of disease in crops and selection of crops that best suits the given weather and soil conditions along with the variety of seed. The deep learning
model used is convolutional neural network that predicts the disease based upon the probability calculated through image processing. While in case of selection of crops, a number of 
calculations, a combination of metric system is used to predict the best crop.
